Who built and created the initial project?
Mr. J / sprion / Jeric T.

What is the JericVerse Launcher (JVL)?
It is a cross-platform application that runs all JericVerse games, tools & applications for the community in the ecosystem. It will be open-sourced in the next few seasons.

Why was it built?
As the ecosystem expands from the AGENT1 Living NFT project, holders get to experience more parts of the ecosystem. JVL puts all this in one place, for Holders to easily access all parts of the ecosystem. Some games and tools must be launched from a local computer to provide the full experience.

Where can the JericVerse Launcher (JVL) be found?
Now hosted on GITHUB, JericVerse.com and Moonlanders.game

When was it first released?
JVL is scheduled to be released in December 2022.

How does it work?
JVL runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, while currently centralized in nature for full effectiveness, will slowly be designed into a decentralized architecture, to fit the evergreen design of the JericVerse ecosystem, where everyone can be involved to maintain, upgrade and keep the system going.
