Who built and created the initial project?
Mr. J / sprion / Jeric T.

What is the JericVerse Launcher (JVL)?
It is a cross-platform application that runs all JericVerse games, tools & applications for the community in the ecosystem. It will be open-sourced in the next few seasons.

Why was it built?
As the ecosystem expands from the AGENT1 Living NFT, holders get to experience the expanding JericVerse ecosystem. JVL puts all this in one place, for Holders to easily access all parts of the ecosystem. Some games and tools must be launched from a local computer to enjoy the full experience that has been designed.

Where can the JericVerse Launcher (JVL) be found?
Now hosted on GITHUB, JericVerse.com and Moonlanders.game

When was it first released?
JVL was scheduled and released in December 2022.

How does it work?
JVL runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. Will eventually become open sourced as part of the decentralizing design. This fits the evergreen design of the JericVerse ecosystem, where everyone can be involved to build together, and rise together.
